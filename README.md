Main Goals That I Wanted This App To Have => 
   Change The Images Src Randomly on Click 
    Persist The High Score On Refresh 
    Make It Mobile Responsive 
    All of Which I was Able to achieve 


What i have Learned After this Project =>  I Learned How to Use React Hooks , Especially useEffect Hook
I Used Refs And i build a simple picture api/directory 
I used Parcel Bundler Instead of Webpack  And I Learned A bit More About Scss
